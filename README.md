##  Overview

The **commission** project focuses on calculating commissions for financial transactions, enhancing the processing of operations within its architecture. Central to the repository is the **`CalculateCommissionCommand.php`** file, which orchestrates commission calculation strategies with modularity and clear logic. Leveraging Symfony's capabilities, the core functionalities involve processing transactions from a input file, converting currencies to EUR for consistency, and utilizing different calculation strategies based on transaction details, such as EU/non-EU country distinctions. By centralizing commission calculation logic and integrating services like CommissionCalculatorInterface and ExchangeRateProvider, **commission** offers a streamlined approach to managing transaction commissions, ultimately optimizing financial operations within its ecosystem.
